	<div class="title">Recursive cases must get closer to a base case</div>
	<div id="promptDiv">
		<p>A proper recursive method needs to "make progress" as it calls
		itself again and again -- otherwise, it will run forever.</p>
		
		<p>  A way to understand 
		"making progress" is in the way the method's arguments change across successive 
		recursive calls.
		On each successive call, the argument(s) should move closer to a value (or values) 
		that will trigger a base case, and thus stop the recursive process.</p>
		<p>  For example,
			consider the <tt>halved</tt> method in the preceding activity. 
			Its argument <tt>n</tt>,
			if large enough, results in a recursive call whose argument is closer
			to 0, which should trigger a base case.  In this way the recursion
			is "making progress" as it calls itself with a new argument.</p>
