ORIGINAL SETUP
Assignment text goes in here:

1) Intro page briefly explaining the technique of writing a separate 
method that take parameters of different lengths, maybe running through
an example.

2) write reverse4 (in ReverseHelpers), and test by running ReverseHelpersTest
(note, we'll try to automate the running of junit tests, but for now they may 
have to right-click on ReverseHelpersTest.java and select "Run as..." 
and then "Junit test".

3) page explaining how the helper solution will be veeeery similar 
across the various methods for specific lengths..  You can generalize this by 
writing a proper recursion.

4) write reverse recursively, in Reverse.java, and test with ReverseTest

5) One more step, I think, where they need to look at a recursive procedure 
and predict its output, or something non-writing.  Maybe debugging.
