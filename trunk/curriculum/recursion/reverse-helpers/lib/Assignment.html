ORIGINAL SETUP
Assignment text goes in here:

0) Intro page (HTML: introduction.html)
* We are going to use recursion to solve reverse -- so no for or while loops...  depends on understanding recursion.  
  Check out "recrusion intro" if you need to.
* What is reverse? (examples)
* We are going to first look at writing separate methods for different length strings.  Give quick example. 

1) This could get painful (JAVA: NaiveReverse.java)
* Write reverse for a six length string, please.  Don't use loops (or the builtin reverse!).
*  show them reverse1-5?
* Test your solution

2) Johnny has an idea (MC: rev9helper.html)
* Johnny thinks using a helper function will make writing reverse9 easier.  His teacher suggest using reverse8 as
the helper.  Here is Johnny's solution, referring to a presumably working "reverse8" method:
public static String reverse9(String input) {
  

   }


3) Write reverse17 (JAVA: reverse17.java)
* write reverse17 using an existing method reverse16.  
  * We've provided you two helper functions: allbutfirst and allbutlast.  (explanation).  Try to use them.
* Test it.  (note: we really should have them be able to use a working reverse16 in a main method.  Maybe import
  another class with the method, in a jar?  But, will this screw up the testing where we check that they 
  used reverse16 via a child class?  Might have to do tricky things in that included class...  callbacks, etc


4) Notice the pattern! (MC: pattern.html)

page explaining how the helper solution will be veeeery similar 
across the various methods for specific lengths..  You can generalize this by 
writing a proper recursion.

* Johnny writes reverse w/o a base case.  Predict via MC.

5) ?
Notice reverse1 is different.  Base Cases...


6) Writing reverse using recursion (JAVA: Reverse.java)
