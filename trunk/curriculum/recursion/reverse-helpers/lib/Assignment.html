ORIGINAL SETUP
Assignment text goes in here:

0) Intro page (HTML: introduction.html)
* We are going to use recursion to solve reverse -- so no for or while loops...  depends on understanding recursion.  
  Check out "recursion intro" if you need to.
* What is reverse? (examples)
* We are going to first look at writing separate methods for different length strings.  Give quick example. 

1) This could get painful (JAVA: NaiveReverse.java)
* Write reverse for a six length string, please.  Don't use loops (or the builtin reverse!).
*  show them reverse1-5?
* Test your solution

2) Johnny has an idea (MC: rev9helper.html)
* Johnny thinks using a helper function will make writing reverse9 easier.  His teacher suggest using reverse8 as
the helper.  Here is Johnny's solution, referring to a presumably working "reverse8" method:
public static String reverse9(String input) {
   String partial = reverse8(s.substring(0,8));  
   return (input + partial);
   [or...]
   String partial = reverse8(s.substring(1,9));
   String firstLetter = s.substring(0,1);
   return (firstLetter + partial);
   }

Johnny tests his method with the string "sweetness"  "confident".  What will it return?
  * tnedifnoc <correct rev>
  * ctnedifno  <correct ans>
  * tconfiden
  * off by one?


3) Write reverse17 (JAVA: reverse17.java)
* write reverse17 using an existing method reverse16.  
  * We've provided you two helper functions: allbutfirst and allbutlast.  (explanation).  Try to use them.
* Test it.  (note: we really should have them be able to use a working reverse16 in a main method.  Maybe import
  another class with the method, in a jar?  But, will this screw up the testing where we check that they 
  used reverse16 via a child class?  Might have to do tricky things in that included class...  callbacks, etc


4) Notice the pattern! (MC: pattern.html)

page explaining how the helper solution will be veeeery similar -- show rev5 in terms of rev4,
rev932 in terms of rev931.
Johnny tries to write a single method to handle all length strings using recrusion.
What will happen when he runs this with the input "doesthiswork?" ?

public String reverse (String s) {
   return ( reverse(allButLast(s)) + s.substring(0,1) );
   }

Choices:
  * crash almost immediately
  * enter into an infinite recursion (running forever, although eventually crashing the computer)
  * return "?krowsihtseod" -- the correct reversal!
  * return a string that isn't the correct reversal


5) Recursion has a special case: the base case (HTML: basecase.html)
notice that reverse1() has a different pattern.  It is a base case, which is always necessary 
for recursive methods to work correctly.


6) Writing reverse using recursion (JAVA: Reverse.java)
