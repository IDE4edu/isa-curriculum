		<p>
The error is that <tt>reverse("?")</tt> should be handled differently from <tt>reverse("doesthiswork?")</tt>.
A one-character string in this situation is referred to as a <i>base case</i>.
The <tt>reverse</tt> method should not make a recursive call when given a one-character string;
instead, it should do some computation,
then return to its caller. 
</p>
<p>
Every correct recursive method will include one or more base cases.
Every recursive call should provide arguments that get closer to the base cases.
Omitted or faulty base case handling most likely results in an infinite recursion.
