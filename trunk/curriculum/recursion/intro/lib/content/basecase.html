	<div class="title">A base case is used to stop a recursion</div>
	<div id="promptDiv"><p>As we noted in the previous activities, we
		need a way to get the method to stop calling itself. This involves
		some kind of conditional, where the method will choose one of two (or
		more) different cases each time it is called: </p>
		
		<pre>
		if (we shouldn’t make a recursive call) {
			…  
		} else { 
			… 
			make a recursive call; 
			… 
		}</pre>
		<p> The
		“shouldn’t make a recursive call” code is referred to as a base case;
		code that includes a recursive call is a recursive case.</p></div>
