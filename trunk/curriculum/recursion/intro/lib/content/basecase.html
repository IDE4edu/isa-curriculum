	<div class="title">A base case is used to stop a recursion</div>
	<div id="promptDiv">
		<p>As we noted in the previous activities, we need a way to get
			the method to stop calling itself. This involves some kind of
			conditional, where the method will choose one of two (or more)
			different cases each time it is called:</p>

		<pre>
		if (<i>we shouldn’t make a recursive call</i>) {
			... <i>do some things</i> ...  
		} else { 
			... 
			<i>make a recursive call</i>; 
			...
		}</pre>
		<p>The &ldquo;<i>do some things</i>&rdquo; code is referred to as a
			<u>base case</u>.  The other code run in the <tt>else</tt> condition is a <u>recursive case</u>. </p>
			
			 
			<p>Depending on what your method needs to do, there may be more 
			than one base case, and more than recursive case.  Remember, if there isn't at
			least one base case, the method will never stop!</p>
