	<div id="promptDiv">
		<p>What is recursion? It's a programming technique in which a
			method calls itself. For example:</p>
		<pre><code data-language="java">public static void recur ( ) {
	System.out.println ("This is recursion!");
	recur ( );
}</code></pre>

		<p>
			In the method
			<tt>recur</tt>, notice the second line: there is a call to the
			<tt>recur</tt>
			method from within the
			<tt>recur</tt>
			method itself. We refer to the call as a <i>recursive call</i>.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this case, a call to
			<tt>recur</tt>
			produces fairly useless results. It will produce the output:

		
		<pre>This is recursion!
This is recursion!
This is recursion!
This is recursion!
This is recursion!
This is recursion!</pre>

		<p>on and on and on and on...</p>
