<h3>
Methods
</h3>
<p>
<i>Methods</i> are Java’s mechanism for breaking down a computation into smaller 
(and, we hope, more manageable) pieces. (Methods are also known as <i>subprograms</i>.) 
This kind of <i>decomposition</i> is analogous to splitting a book into chapters 
or sorting documents into folders in a file cabinet.
</p>
<p>
Every method has a <i>name</i> by which the method is accessed, 
and a <i>body</i> of statements that perform the computation associated with the method. 
When a program is run and encounters a <i>call</i> to or an <i>invocation</i> of a method, 
it executes the statements in the method body 
and then resumes execution at the statement immediately following the call.
</p>
<p>
A method also has a <i>type</i> and a list of <i>parameters</i> that describe information 
to be communicated to the method when it runs or sent back to the caller when it’s finished. 
(Together, the name, type, and parameter list constitute the method’s <i>header</i>.) 
We’ll start with methods of type <code>void</code> that have empty parameter lists.
</p>
<p>
Consider the following program.
</p>
<pre>
public class VoidMethodsNoParams {

public static void m1 ( ) {
	System.out.println (“A”);
}

public static void m2 ( ) {
	System.out.println (“B”);
}

public static void m3 ( ) {
	System.out.println (“C”);
	m2 ( );
}

public static void main (String [ ] args) {
	m1 ( );
	m3 ( );
}
}
</pre>
<p>
The program has four methods. All are <code>public</code>, meaning anyone can access them. 
All <code>are</code> static, specific to a class rather than to the instances of the class 
(i.e. the objects described by the class). 
All have type <code>void</code>, so they don’t directly return any information to their callers. 
The parentheses indicate an empty parameter list.
</p>
<p>
When the program is run, the <code>main</code> method is called. 
It starts with a call to <code>m1</code> that prints a line and returns. 
Next <code>m3</code> is called; it prints a line, then calls <code>m2</code>. 
The latter method prints a line, then returns to <code>m3</code>, which returns to <code>main</code>. 
Finally, the program exits.
</p>
<p>
Exercise: What gets printed as a result of running the program above? choices: AC, ABC, ACB, no output
</p>
<p>
Exercise: Change <code>main</code> so that it calls two of the other methods 
(while still not calling <code>System.out.println</code>) and produces CBB as output. *** code is provided
</p>
<h3>
Parameters and arguments
</h3>
<p>
<i>Parameters</i> describe information that's communicated to the method when it executes. 
A real-world example is the set of selector buttons on a vending machine: 
buttons on a coffee machine tell the “make coffee” method how much cream to use and how strong a brew to generate; 
buttons on a snack vending machine indicate which snack to output.
</p>
<p>
The parameters are separated by commas. Each parameter consists of a type and a name. Here’s an example method header:
</p>
<pre>
public static void printTotal (double subTotal, int discount)
</pre>
<p>
<code>printTotal</code>’s two parameters describe a <code>double</code> and an <code>int</code>, 
which will be referred to by the names <code>subTotal</code> and <code>discount</code> (respectively) within the <code>printTotal</code> method.
</p>
<p>
Calling a method with parameters requires that values be associated with the parameters prior to executing the method. 
These values are referred to as <i>arguments</i>.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an example. It contains three methods, each with a single parameter. 
Currently <code>m1</code> and <code>m2</code> make no use of the <code>lineCount</code> parameter; that’s the first thing we’ll fix.
</p>
<pre>
public class VoidMethodsWithParams {

	public static void m1 (int lineCount) {
		System.out.println (“A”);
	}

	public static void m2 (int lineCount) {
		System.out.println (“B”);
		m1 ( 100 );	// will be changed
	}

	public static void main (String [ ] args) {
		m1 ( 100 );	// should be changed
		m2 ( 100 );	// should be changed
	}
}
</pre>
<p>
As noted above, <code>m1</code> makes no use of its parameter <code>lineCount</code>. 
As a result, <code>m1</code> produces just one line of output regardless of what argument is passed to it. 
</p>
<p>
Exercise: Insert a <code>for</code> loop in <code>m1</code> 
so that the number of A’s printed in <code>m1</code> is <code>lineCount</code>. For example, the call
</p>
<pre>
	m1(3)
</pre>
<p>
should print 3 A’s. (You may wish to change the <code>main</code> method to make testing more convenient.)
</p>
<p>
Exercise: Now modify <code>m2</code> (using the copy of <code>m1</code> that you just created) 
so that it prints <code>lineCount</code> B’s and <code>lineCount</code> A’s, in any order.
</p>
<p>
Now modify <code>m2</code> so that half the lines printed contain a B and the other half contain an A. 
If <code>lineCount</code> is odd, the number of B’s printed should be 1 less than the number of A’s. Examples:
</p>
<pre>
	m2 (4)
</pre>
<p>
should print 2 B’s and 2 A’s, and
</p>
<pre>
	m2 (7)
</pre>
<p>
should print 3 B’s and 4 A’s.
</p>
<h3>
Argument handling
</h3>
<p>
We now examine how arguments are passed to a method in more detail. 
The code that calls the method has some values--the arguments--that are to be communicated to the method; 
the method has a place to put each value, each with a name (the parameter name in the method header). 
The calling code must provide exactly as many values as the called method has parameters, 
and each argument type must match the type of the corresponding parameter. 
The argument values are <i>copied</i> to the places in the method, and the method is executed.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an example. On the left is a method named <code>swap</code>--misleadingly, as it turns out. 
On the right is a program segment that initializes two variables and then calls <code>swap</code>.
</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
public void swap (int a, int b) {
    int temp;
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>
	int n1;
	int n2;
	n1 = 27;
	n2 = 13;
	swap (n1, n2);
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The call to <code>swap</code> sets up two internal variables, one named <code>a</code> and the other named <code>b</code>. 
<code>n1</code>’s value is copied to <code>a</code> and <code>n2</code>’s value is copied to <code>b</code>. 
The statements in <code>swap</code> are executed, but only the variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are involved. 
When <code>swap</code> is done executing, its temporary variables are discarded, and control returns to the caller. 
The values in <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> are exactly as they were before the call to <code>swap</code>.
</p>
<h3>
Typed methods
</h3>
<p>
<i>Typed</i> methods, also known as <i>functions</i>, return a value to the caller. This allows more convenient chaining of method calls. 
</p>
<p>
Defining a typed method differs from defining a void method in two ways. 
First, the type name--say, <code>int</code> or <code>double</code>--replaces <code>void</code> in the method header. 
Second, the method body must contain at least one <code>return</code> statement that specifies what value the method should return. 
The caller of the typed method should provide a variable in which to store the returned value, 
or alternatively supply the returned value as an argument for another typed method.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an example.
</p>
<pre>
public class TypedMethods {

	public static int silly (int n1, int n2) {
		return 2 * n1 + n2;
	}

	public static void main (String [ ] args) {
		System.out.println (silly (3, 5));
	}
}
</pre>
<p>
Exercise: What does the program print? Choices: 8, 11, 13, 16
</p>
<p>
Exercise: Replace the 3 by an argument that causes 7 to be printed.
</p>
<p>
Exercise: Fill in the blank in the <code>main</code> method below so that the program prints 1.
</p>
<pre>
	public static void main (String [ ] args) {
		System.out.println (silly ( ___ , silly (4, 3));
	}
</pre>
<p>
Exercise: Fill in the blank in the <code>main</code> method below so that the program prints 1.
</p>
<pre>
	public static void main (String [ ] args) {
		System.out.println (silly ( 5 , silly ( ___ , 3));
	}
</pre>
<h3>
More exercises
</h3>
<p>
1.	Consider the following method, which simulates the rolling of a six-sided die.
</p>
<pre>
	public int dieRoll (Random ranGen) {
		return ranGen.nextInt (6);
	}
</pre>
<p>
One would call it by supplying a random number generator:
</p>
<pre>
	public static void main (String [ ] args) {
		Random ranGen = new Random ( );
		System.out.println (“I rolled a “ + dieRoll (ranGen));
		System.out.println (“I rolled a “ + dieRoll (ranGen));
		System.out.println (“I rolled a “ + dieRoll (ranGen));
	}
</pre>
<p>
Fill in the blank in the method <code>twoDiceRoll</code> so that it represents 
the simultaneous rolling of two dice. Don’t call any method other than <code>nextInt</code>.
</p>
<pre>
	public int twoDiceRoll (Random ranGen) {
		return _____ ;
	}
</pre>
<p>
2.	Fill in the blanks in the program below so that the method named <code>digitsSwitched</code> 
takes as argument an integer between 1 and 99, inclusive, 
and returns the value obtained by interchanging the two digits of the argument. 
Thus, given 35 as an argument, <code>digitSwitched</code> should return 53; 
given 5 (i.e. 05), it should return 50; and given 60, it should return 6. 
Reminder: the % operator lets you access the last digit in an integer.
</p>
<pre>
	public int digitsSwitched (int twoDigitInt) {
		_______ ;		// ok to have more than one line
		return ______ ;
	}

	public static void main (String [ ] args) {
		System.out.println (“switching of digits in 35 should give 53, gives “ + digitSwitched (35);
		System.out.println (“switching of digits in 5 should give 50, gives “ + digitSwitched (5);
		System.out.println (“switching of digits in 60 should give 6, gives “ + digitSwitched (60);
	}
</pre>
<p>
3.	Write an <code>int</code> method named <code>digitCount</code> that, 
given a positive integer as argument, returns the number of digits in that number. 
Don’t count leading zeroes. Some examples: <code>digitCount (4)</code> should return 1, 
<code>digitCount (314159)</code> should return 6, and <code>digitCount (4006)</code> should return 4.
