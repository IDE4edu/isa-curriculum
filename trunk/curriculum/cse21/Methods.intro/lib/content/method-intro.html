	<div class="title">What are Methods?</div>
	<div>

		<p>
			<i>Methods</i> are Java’s mechanism for breaking down a computation
			into smaller (and, we hope, more manageable) pieces. (Methods are
			also known as <i>subprograms</i>.) This kind of <i>decomposition</i>
			is analogous to splitting a book into chapters or sorting documents
			into folders in a file cabinet.
		</p>
		<p>Every method has</p>
		<ul>
			<li>a <u>header</u> which contains three pieces of information:
			<ul>
			<li>a <u>name</u> by which the method is accessed,
			</li>
						
			<li>a <u>type</u> that indicated why type of data the method
			will pass back, and
			<li>a list of <u>parameters</u> that
			describe the information to be given to the method when it runs
			(parameters allow methods to do different things in different 
			circumstances)
		
			</li>
			</ul>

			<li>a <u>body</u> of statements that perform the computation
				associated with the method.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			When a program is run and encounters a <i>call</i> to or an <i>invocation</i>
			of a method&mdash;using its name&mdash;the program executes the statements in the method body and then
			resumes execution at the statement immediately following the call.
		</p>
		<p>

			We’ll start with methods that have return types of
						<code>void</code>, meaning they don't return anything,
						and have 
			 empty parameter lists, meaning the method will always run the same way.
		</p>
