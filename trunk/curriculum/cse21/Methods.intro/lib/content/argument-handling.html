	<div class="title">Argument handling</div>
	<div>
		<p>
			We now examine how arguments are passed to a method in more detail.
			The code that calls the method has some values--the arguments--that
			are to be communicated to the method; the method has a place to put
			each value, each with a name (the parameter name in the method
			header). The calling code must provide exactly as many values as the
			called method has parameters, and each argument type must match the
			type of the corresponding parameter. The argument values are <i>copied</i>
			to the places in the method, and the method is executed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here’s an example. On the left is a method named <code>swap</code>&mdash;misleadingly,
			as it turns out. On the right is a program segment that initializes
			two variables and then calls <code>swap</code>.
		</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td><pre><span style="color:firebrick">public void swap</span> (int a, int b) {
    int temp;
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
}</pre></td>
				<td><pre>int n1;
int n2;
n1 = 27;
n2 = 13;
swap (n1, n2);
<span style="color:green">//n1 still 27, n2 still 13</span></pre></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			The call to <code>swap</code> sets up two internal variables, one
			named <code>a</code> and the other named <code>b</code>. <code>n1</code>’s
			value is copied to <code>a</code> and <code>n2</code>’s value is
			copied to <code>b</code>. The statements in <code>swap</code> are
			executed, but only the variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>
			are involved. When <code>swap</code> is done executing, its temporary
			variables are discarded, and control returns to the caller. The
			values in <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code> are exactly as they
			were before the call to <code>swap</code>.
