		<p>
			Only fill-in the parts as indicated in
			<var>CheeseShopv2.java</var>
			, which you'll see in the next step. We expect that you know what
			code belongs in these methods that are called by main, by matching
			the specification to the names of the methods. Do <b>not</b> change
			<var>main</var>
			or the method declarations. Fix the code where the comments indicate
			you should fix it. Right now it will compile and run, but is will
			always return 0.
		</p>

		<p>Your program will do the following (A-F):</p>
		<ol type="A">
			<li>List all the cheese types available and the prices</li>
			<li>Asks the user how many pounds of each type of cheese to
				purchase</li>
			<li>Calculate Sub Total (price*amount of each cheese added
				together)</li>
			<li>Discount of Sub Total</li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>for a $10 discount if their purchase is $50 or over</li>
				<li>an additional $15 discount ($25 total) if $100 or over</</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Ask the user if they would like to see a list of what they
				purchased</li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>If yes, a list comes up showing how much of each type of
					cheese they bought and the cost of each cheese</li>
				<li>Display only the cheese they actually bought</li>
				<li>If no then no itemized information is displayed</li>
			</ol>
			<li>Display Sub Total, Discount and Total Price</li>
		</ol>
