            CSE21 : Lab#13 - 2D Arrays and File Output
        </div>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        	
            This week we will read more than one file as input and create an output file
also. For that purpose we will actually take in two matrices and multiply
them. The result is then written to a file. Most of the code and logic you
need to finish this lab is presented in lecture and also included in this lab
assignment. Your job is to combine each portion to do the job correctly.
        </p>
