		<p>You will declare your own methods for the first time in this lab and fill in the
details. You can figure out what the declaration should be by the way we
are invoking such methods in main. We will walk you through the steps to
do this lab so try to follow the directions and build on each subsequent step.
</p>
<p>Recall the different parts to declaration methods:</p>
<ul><li>Name</li>
<li>Input Parameters (type and name)</li>
<li>Return value (type)</li>
</ul>
<p>
We invoke or call the method declared by using Name (input1, input2 … ) so
on and if the method does not take in any arguments then we use empty
parentheses (). Try to answer the questions as you encounter them instead
of saving them till the end since that will help you solve each step before
moving onto the next exercise before you are ready.
