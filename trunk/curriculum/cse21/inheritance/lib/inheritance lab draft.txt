Draft of first inheritance lab
------------------------------
	
(1a) Show them the Counter class, introduce Runner.  
(1b) where is the constructor?  
(1c) create a Counter instance that holds value of 3
(1d) make a Counter and use 7 reset() or increment() statements to end
    up with value = 3.  


(2) Update eclipse, look at new Feedback view


(3)Now have them define the ModNCounter class,
overriding the value method to make it work.

(3b)Now have them override the increment method to make it work.

(3c) fill in DecrementableCounter.decrement()



(3d)
Write SeasonCounter which cycles through the four seasons.
Write a method toString() which returns "spring", "summer", "fall", or "winter"
depending on the current value.





**************
The next activity is something we used on an exam last summer.
The idea is to keep track of how long the ArrayList gets.
