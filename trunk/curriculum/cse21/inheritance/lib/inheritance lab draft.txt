Draft of first inheritance lab
------------------------------

(1) Should we explain inheritance to them? If so, we can use the following examples:
	superclass Refillable, subclass SoftDrinkMachine, subclass CandyJar
	superclass Shape, subclass Rectangle
	
	
	
(2a) Show them the Counter class, introduce Runner.  
(2aa) where is the constructor?  
(2b) create a Counter instance that holds value of 3
(2c) make a Counter and use 7 reset() or increment() statements to end
    up with value = 3.  


(3)
TODO - rename to ModNCounter
Now have them define the CyclicCounter class,
overriding the value method to make it work.

(3b)Now have them override the increment method to make it work.

(3c) fill in DecrementalCounter.decrement()



(3d)
Write SeasonCounter which cycles through the four seasons.
Write a method toString() which returns "spring", "summer", "fall", or "winter"
depending on the current value.





**************
The next activity is something we used on an exam last summer.
The idea is to keep track of how long the ArrayList gets.
