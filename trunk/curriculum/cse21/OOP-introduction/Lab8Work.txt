Q1: (card_v1/Card.java) Can you put the instance variable declarations at the 
    bottom of a class, after the methods that refer to them?
    

    
    
Q2: (card_v1/Card.java) The Card constructor takes two arguments, 
    a rankName (a String like "ace", "3", etc) and a suit name (a String
    like "hearts" or "spades").  
    	Would a  1-argument constructor make sense? Would a 0-argument 
    constructor? Why or why not?



    
Q3: (card_v1/Card.java) Change line 12 in the constructor, where rankName
    gets set, to
                rankName = rankName;
    Explain what happens and why it happens.
