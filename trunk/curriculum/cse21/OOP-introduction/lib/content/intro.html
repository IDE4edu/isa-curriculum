	<div>
		<p>In Object-oriented programs, a programmer uses combinations of separate <i>objects</i>
		to perform the work of the program.  An object is a self-contained 'thing' that can
		have properties and behaviors.   A <i>class</i> is a template, or blueprint, for 
		objects of a particular kind (i.e., that belong 
		to that class).

		<p class="brownQuote">An object can have instance variable&mdash;regular Java variables 
		that belong to the object&mdash;and represent properties of the object.  Different
		objects of the same kind (i.e., that were made using the same <i>class</i>)
		will have different values for these instance variables.  <br><br>
		An object can also have methods that represent behaviors the object can perform.</p>


<p>In this assignment, we'll work with a <var>Card</var> class that represents typical playing card as used in games like poker.
