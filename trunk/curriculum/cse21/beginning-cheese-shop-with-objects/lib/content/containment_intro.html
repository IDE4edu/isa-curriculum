	<div class="title">The Containment design: when one object controls other objects</div>
	<div>
		<p>A very common pattern of object-oriented programs involves containment.  In
		these programs, an object of one type <i>contains</i> an object (or objects)
		of another type (or types).  This is common enough in the real world:
		 </p>
		<ul>
		<li>A <i>refrigerator</i> could hold <i>Milk</i>, produce objects of different types, and so
		forth, in its different compartments.</li>
		<li>A <i>deck of cards</i> contains <i>cards</i> in a certain order. </li>
		<li>An <i>address book</i> contains <i>addresses</i>, perhaps grouped into categories.</li>
		<li></li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Containment implies more than the simple linking of objects: it implies that 
		the container has some control over the objects that it contains, invoking
		their behaviors in a privileged way, creating and deleting the objects, keeping 
		track of what it contains, and
		so forth.</p>
		
		<p class="brownQuote">In this assignment, you will program a <var>Cheese</var> class 
		that stores certain information about itself, and a <var>Store</var> class that 
		contains certain <var>Cheese</var> objects.</p>
